****NOTE****
As of May 2023, this extension is no longer maintained due to losing access to Linkedin Recruiter. There may have been new changes to Linkedin's HTML that can potentially interfere with the functioning of the app. Apologies! Feel free to reach out to me and I can take a look if it is important.
